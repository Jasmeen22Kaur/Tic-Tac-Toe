# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a simple web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates the use of front-end web technologies to create an interactive and user-friendly game that can be played by two players on the same device.

The game consists of a 3×3 grid where players take turns marking their symbols (X or O). The objective of the game is to be the first player to place three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. The application automatically checks for winning conditions after each move and displays the result. In case all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.

The main objective of this project is to understand the basics of DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation using JavaScript, along with designing a clean interface using HTML and CSS.
